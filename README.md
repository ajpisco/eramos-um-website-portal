## üîß Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

This project requires certain environment variables to function properly. Follow these steps:

1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure Email Service (N8N Webhook):**
   Edit the `.env` file and add your N8N webhook configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
   VITE_N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key
   ```

3. **School Contact Information:**
   ```env
   VITE_SCHOOL_EMAIL=contact@eramosum.edu.pt
   VITE_SCHOOL_PHONE=+351-xxx-xxx-xxx
   VITE_ADMISSIONS_EMAIL=admissions@eramosum.edu.pt
   ```

### üîê Security Notes

- **Never commit** your actual `.env` file to version control
- Environment variables in Vite are **exposed to the client** - avoid putting truly sensitive data here
- For production, use your hosting platform's environment variable system (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

### üìß N8N Webhook Setup

This project uses N8N workflows for email sending:

1. Set up an N8N instance or use a hosted service
2. Create a webhook workflow for email processing
3. Configure your webhook URL and API key
4. Add the credentials to your `.env` file

**Email Flow:**
- Frontend sends form data to N8N webhook
- N8N processes the data and sends emails
- Supports attachments and retry logic
